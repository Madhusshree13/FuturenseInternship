# Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling Project

## About the Project
This repository contains work completed during my internship, focusing on comprehensive **data analysis** workflows.  
The project involves:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, outlier treatment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions, relationships, and key patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building and evaluating machine learning models for prediction tasks.
- **Visualization**: Creating insightful visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

The objective was to extract meaningful insights from raw data and build robust predictive models that could assist decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost (as needed)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for experimentation and documentation

---

## Key Highlights
- **Data Cleaning**: Imputation strategies, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **EDA**:  
  - Distribution plots  
  - Correlation heatmaps  
  - Feature importance analysis
- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  - Model training and tuning  
  - Evaluation using cross-validation, accuracy, F1-score, ROC curves
- **Visualization**:  
  - Interactive dashboards and static charts for business stakeholders

---

## Outcome
Successfully delivered actionable insights and predictive models that demonstrated **[insert your result, e.g., 85% accuracy in predicting customer churn]** during the internship period.

---

##  Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance
- Deployment of the best models using Flask/Django (optional next phase)
- Building a full interactive dashboard (using tools like Streamlit or Dash)
